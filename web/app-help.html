    <h2>To share your location</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Press "Share" button and choose the email/phone number
      <li>Confirm email or sms
    </ol>
    <p>Now people can view your realtime location updates and you can see their location on a map as well.</p>

    <h2>Foreground mode vs. background</h2>

    <p>To share location continuously, don't close the app and don't lock your iPhone. If "Use proximity sensor" option is used,
      the device screen will turn off once you've put it close to any surface:
      into the pocket or bag (or just placed iPhone upside down).</p>
    <p>You can share location in background mode (when iPhone is locked or app is not active) for up to 10 minutes.</p>

    <h2>To stop location sharing</h2>
    <p>Click <img src="refresh@2x.png" width="17" height="14"> icon next to link at the bottom of the main screen. Location is no longer updated at the previous URL.</p>
